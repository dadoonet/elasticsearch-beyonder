Elasticsearch Beyonder
======================

Welcome to the [Elasticsearch](http://www.elastic.co/) Beyonder project.

This project comes historically from [spring-elasticsearch](https://github.com/dadoonet/spring-elasticsearch) project.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple Java library which helps to create indices, mappings, etc. when
you start your application.

Getting Started
===============

Maven dependency
----------------

Import elasticsearch-beyonder in you project `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>fr.pilato.elasticsearch</groupId>
  <artifactId>elasticsearch-beyonder</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

You need to import as well the elasticsearch client you want to use by adding one of the following
dependencies to your `pom.xml` file.

For example, here is how to import the REST Client to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.elasticsearch.client</groupId>
    <artifactId>elasticsearch-rest-client</artifactId>
    <version>${elasticsearch.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

For example, here is how to import the Transport Client to your project (deprecated):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.elasticsearch.client</groupId>
    <artifactId>transport</artifactId>
    <version>${elasticsearch.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using a SNAPSHOT version of elasticsearch-beyonder, you need to add the Sonatype repository to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <name>Central Portal Snapshots</name>
    <id>central-portal-snapshots</id>
    <url>https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/</url>
    <releases>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

Adding Beyonder to your client
------------------------------

Elasticsearch provides a [Low Level Rest Client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api-client/current/java-rest-low.html).
You can create it like this:

```java
RestClient client = RestClient.builder(HttpHost.create("http://127.0.0.1:9200")).build();
```

Once you have the client, you can use it to manage automatic creation of index, mappings, templates and aliases.
To activate those features, you only need to pass to Beyonder the Rest Client instance:

```java
ElasticsearchBeyonder.start(client);
```

By default, Beyonder will try to locate resources from `elasticsearch` directory within your classpath.
We will use this default value for the rest of the documentation.

But you can change this using:

```java
ElasticsearchBeyonder.start(client, "models/myelasticsearch");
```

In that case, Beyonder will search for resources from `models/myelasticsearch`.

There is also a more complete version of the `start` method with:

```java
ElasticsearchBeyonder.start(client, "models/myelasticsearch", true);
```

This last parameter is known as `force`. It removes any existing index which is managed by Beyonder.
It is super useful for integration testing but it is **super dangerous** in production.

For the record, when your cluster is secured, you can use for example the
[Basic Authentication](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api-client/current/_basic_authentication.html):

```java
CredentialsProvider credentialsProvider = new BasicCredentialsProvider();
credentialsProvider.setCredentials(AuthScope.ANY, new UsernamePasswordCredentials("elastic", "changeme"));
RestClient client = RestClient.builder(HttpHost.create("http://127.0.0.1:9200"))
        .setHttpClientConfigCallback(hcb -> hcb.setDefaultCredentialsProvider(credentialsProvider)).build();
ElasticsearchBeyonder.start(client);
```

Managing indices
----------------

When Beyonder starts, it tries to find index names and settings in the classpath.

If you add in your classpath a file named `elasticsearch/twitter`, the `twitter` index will be automatically created
at startup if it does not exist yet.

If you add in your classpath a file named `elasticsearch/twitter/_settings.json`, it will be automatically applied to define
settings for your `twitter` index.

For example, create the following file `src/main/resources/elasticsearch/twitter/_settings.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 3,
    "number_of_replicas": 0
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "message": { "type": "text" },
      "foo": { "type": "text" }
    }
  }
}
```

By default, Beyonder will not overwrite an index if it already exists.
This can be overridden by setting `force` to `true` in the expanded factory method
`ElasticsearchBeyonder.start()`.

You can also provide a file named `_update_settings.json` to update your index settings 
and a file named `_update_mapping.json` if you want to update an existing mapping. 
Note that Elasticsearch do not allow updating all settings and mappings.

You can for example add a new field, or change the `search_analyzer` for a given field but you can not modify
the field `type`.

Considering the previous example we saw, you can create a `elasticsearch/twitter/_update_settings.json` to update the
number of replicas:

```json
{
    "number_of_replicas" : 1
}
```

And you can create `elasticsearch/twitter/_update_mapping.json`:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "message" : {"type" : "text", "search_analyzer": "keyword" },
    "bar" : { "type" : "text" }
  }
}
```

This will change the `search_analyzer` for the `message` field and will add a new field named `bar`.
All other existing fields (like `foo` in the previous example) won't be changed.

If you would like to use [math expressions for the index name](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/api-conventions.html#api-date-math-index-names), 
you can use the URI encoded version of the expression.
For example, the following directory structure will end up creating an index named `my-index-{now/d}`:

```txt
.
└── %3Cmy-index-%7Bnow%2Fd%7D%3E
    ├── _data
    │   └── bulk.ndjson
    └── _settings.json
```

Managing aliases
----------------

An alias is helpful to define or remove an alias to a given index. You could also use index templates to do that 
automatically when the index is created, but you can also define a file `elasticsearch/_aliases.json`:

```json
{
  "actions" : [
    { "remove": { "index": "test_1", "alias": "test" } },
    { "add":  { "index": "test_2", "alias": "test" } }
  ]
}
```

When Beyonder starts, it will automatically send the content to the [Aliases API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-aliases.html).

Managing index templates (aka templates V2)
-------------------------------------------

Since version 7.13, the [new index template management API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-templates.html) is supported.
It allows to define both [component templates](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-component-template.html)
and [index templates](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-put-template.html).

### Component templates

To define component templates, you can create json files within the `elasticsearch/_component_templates/` dir.

Let's first create a `elasticsearch/_component_templates/component1.json`:

```json
{
  "template": {
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "@timestamp": {
          "type": "date"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then a second component template as `elasticsearch/_component_templates/component2.json`:

```json
{
  "template": {
    "mappings": {
      "runtime": {
        "day_of_week": {
          "type": "keyword",
          "script": {
            "source": "emit(doc['@timestamp'].value.dayOfWeekEnum.getDisplayName(TextStyle.FULL, Locale.ROOT))"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When Beyonder starts, it will create 2 component templates into elasticsearch, named respectively `component1`
and `component2`.

### Index templates

To define index templates, you can create json files within the `elasticsearch/_index_templates/` dir.

Let's create a `elasticsearch/_index_templates/template_1.json`:

```json
{
  "index_patterns": ["te*", "bar*"],
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "number_of_shards": 1
    },
    "mappings": {
      "_source": {
        "enabled": true
      },
      "properties": {
        "host_name": {
          "type": "keyword"
        },
        "created_at": {
          "type": "date",
          "format": "EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss Z yyyy"
        }
      }
    },
    "aliases": {
      "mydata": { }
    }
  },
  "priority": 500,
  "composed_of": ["component1", "component2"],
  "version": 3,
  "_meta": {
    "description": "my custom"
  }
}
```

When Beyonder starts, it will create the index templates named `template_1` into elasticsearch. 
Note that this index template references 2 component templates that must be available before Beyonder starts
or defined within the `component_templates` dir as we saw just before.

Managing pipelines
------------------

A pipeline is a definition of a series of processors that are to be executed in the same order as they are declared while 
documents are being indexed. Please note that this feature is only supported when you use the REST client not the Transport client.

For example, setting one fields value based on another field by using an Set Processor you can add a file named `elasticsearch/_pipelines/set_field_processor.json`
in your project:

```json
{
  "description" : "Twitter pipeline",
  "processors" : [
    {
      "set" : {
        "field": "copy",
        "value": "{{otherField}}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Index lifecycles
----------------

To define an [index lifecycle](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-lifecycle-management.html), 
you can create json files within the `elasticsearch/_index_lifecycles/` dir.

Let's create a `elasticsearch/_index_lifecycles/my_lifecycle.json`:

```json
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "warm": {
        "min_age": "10d",
        "actions": {
          "forcemerge": {
            "max_num_segments": 1
          }
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "30d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When Beyonder starts, it will create the index templates named `my_lifecycle` into elasticsearch.

Loading sample data
-------------------

If you want to load sample data into your cluster, you can create a directory named `_data` in your classpath.
We support both `ndjson` files which will be loaded using the Bulk API (recommended) and `json` files which will loaded 
using the Index API (slower).

If the `_data` directory is created within an index directory, the data will be loaded only for this index, meaning
that you don't need to define the index name in the bulk headers.

For example, let's assume that you have the following files under your `elasticsearch` directory:

```txt
.
├── _data
│   ├── bulk-001.ndjson
│   └── bulk-002.ndjson
├── person
│   ├── _data
│   │   ├── doc001.json
│   │   ├── doc002.json
│   │   ├── doc003.json
│   │   └── doc004.json
│   └── _index_templates
│       └── person.json
├── test_1
│   ├── _data
│   │   ├── bulk-001.ndjson
│   │   └── bulk-002.ndjson
│   └── _settings.json
├── test_2
│   ├── _data
│   │   └── abcd.ndjson
│   └── _settings.json
└── twitter
    └── _settings.json
```

The `_data/bulk-001.ndjson` file contains:

```ndjson
{ "index" : { "_index" : "twitter" } }
{ "message" : "message 1" }
{ "index" : { "_index" : "twitter" } }
{ "message" : "message 2" }
{ "index" : { "_index" : "twitter" } }
{ "message" : "message 3" }
{ "index" : { "_index" : "twitter" } }
{ "message" : "message 4" }
{ "index" : { "_index" : "twitter" } }
{ "message" : "message 5" }
```

The `person/_data/doc001.json` file contains something like:

```json
{ 
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

Note that it contains no header and could be pretty formatted unlike the `ndjson` format.

JSon documents can be only added within a given index directory and not at the root level in the `_data` directory.

The `test_1/_data/bulk-001.ndjson` file contains:

```ndjson
{ "index" : {  } }
{ "message" : "message 1" }
{ "index" : {  } }
{ "message" : "message 2" }
{ "index" : {  } }
{ "message" : "message 3" }
{ "index" : {  } }
{ "message" : "message 4" }
{ "index" : {  } }
{ "message" : "message 5" }
```

And the `test_2/_data/abcd.ndjson` file contains:

```ndjson
{ "index" : {  } }
{ "message" : "message 1" }
{ "index" : {  } }
{ "message" : "message 2" }
{ "index" : {  } }
{ "message" : "message 3" }
{ "index" : {  } }
{ "message" : "message 4" }
{ "index" : {  } }
{ "message" : "message 5" }
```

When Beyonder starts, it will:

* Create the `person` index with the mapping defined in `elasticsearch/person/_index_templates/person.json`.
* Create the `test_1` index with the settings defined in `elasticsearch/test_1/_settings.json`.
* Create the `test_2` index with the settings defined in `elasticsearch/test_2/_settings.json`.
* Create the `twitter` index with the settings defined in `elasticsearch/twitter/_settings.json`.
* Load the data from `elasticsearch/test_1/_data/bulk-001.ndjson` and then `elasticsearch/test_1/_data/bulk-002.ndjson` 
into the `test_1` index.
* Load the data from `elasticsearch/test_2/_data/abcd.ndjson` into the `test_2` index.
* Load the data from `elasticsearch/_data/bulk-001.ndjson` and `elasticsearch/_data/bulk-002.ndjson` into the indices
specified within the bulk files.
* Load the data from `elasticsearch/person/_data/doc*.json` files into the `person` index.

Note that files are sorted by name before being loaded which means that a file `bulk_001.ndjson` will be loaded before
`bulk_002.ndjson`.

If the index already existed before Beyonder starts, the data won't be loaded unless you are using the `force` option.
This does not apply to the `_data` root directory which will **always load the data at every startup**.

# Tests

This project comes with unit tests and integration tests.
You can disable running them by using `skipTests` option as follows:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

## Unit Tests

If you want to disable only running unit tests, use `skipUnitTests` option:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipUnitTests
```

## Integration Tests

Integration tests are launching a Docker instance using [TestContainers](https://java.testcontainers.org/modules/elasticsearch/). 
So you need to have Docker installed.

If you want to disable running integration tests, use `skipIntegTests` option:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipIntegTests
```

If you wish to run integration tests against a cluster which is already running externally, you can configure the
following settings to locate your cluster:

|       setting        |         default          |
|:--------------------:|:------------------------:|
|   `tests.cluster`    | `https://127.0.0.1:9200` |
| `tests.cluster.user` |        `elastic`         |
| `tests.cluster.pass` |        `changeme`        |

For example:

```sh
mvn clean install -Dtests.cluster=https://127.0.0.1:9200
```

If you want to run your tests against an [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) instance, you can use something like:

```sh
mvn clean install \
    -Dtests.cluster=https://CLUSTERID.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io:443 \
    -Dtests.cluster.user=elastic \
    -Dtests.cluster.pass=GENERATEDPASSWORD
```

Release guide
=============

To release the project, you simply need to run:

```sh
./release.sh
```

If you want to just test the release without deploying anything, run:

```sh
DRY_RUN=1 ./release.sh
```

Why this name?
==============

I was actually looking for a cool name in the marvel characters list and found
that [Beyonder](http://marvel.wikia.com/Beyonder_(Earth-616)) was actually a very
powerful character.

This project gives some features beyond elasticsearch itself. :)
